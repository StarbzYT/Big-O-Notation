Performance of Arrays

When to use arrays:

    - When you need order
    - When you need fast access/insertion and removal (sort of...)
     
Big O of Arrays

Insertion - It depends (if reindexing is involved then it will be O(n), since the indices depend length of the array)

Removal - It depends... (same rule as above)

Access - O(1). Can jump straight to index, regardless of the size of the array.
