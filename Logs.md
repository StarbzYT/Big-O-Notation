Logarithms

The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get a value that is less than or equal to one.

Ex. log(8) = 3 --> 2^3 = 8

Assume the base is two! log2 (subscript 2) == log

General Formula:
    Ex. log(value) = exponent --> 2^exponent = value

Who Cares?
    - Certain searching algorithms have logarithmic time complexity.
    
    - Efficient sorting algorithms involve logarithms.
    
    - Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity.
